# Multi-Armed Bandit

In this project, we explored the effect of the time value of money on the exploitation and exploration tradeoff. Ïµ-greedy, UCB1 and Thompson Sampling were used and their performances were evaluated for different discount factors (100%, 99.9% and 99%).

This project is motivated by a case study of Obama's fundraising campaign (https://www.optimizely.com/insights/blog/how-obama-raised-60-million-by-running-a-simple-experiment/).
